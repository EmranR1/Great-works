    <dd style="font-family:'Courier New';color:blue;">-One interesting fact about me is the fact that I hate it when I get tired and feel incredibly powerless, I exercise everyday to make sure this does not happen, and I have as much stamina as possible for any situation that might happen in life. (sounds a bit hardcore yes).</dd>

  <dd style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>I am interested in Cyber security I believe their job is very important and beneficial for society. I was always interested in Cyber security but my interest increased and increased as I saw Australia in general struggling in the Cyber security sector. With China being constantly on the news for their Cyber attacks on Australia I thought to myself that I should step up to help in any way I can. Now I have both an interest and good motivation which always keeps me going. I believe I can help Australia to strengthen their Cyber security defense and attack. This is my story, my motivation and I believe, my purpose.</strong></dd>
