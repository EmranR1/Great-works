    <dd style="font-family:'Courier New';color:blue;">-One interesting fact about me is the fact that I hate it when I get tired and feel incredibly powerless, I exercise everyday to make sure this does not happen, and I have as much stamina as possible for any situation that might happen in life. (sounds a bit hardcore yes).</dd>
    <h2 style="font-family:'Courier New';color:blue;"><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
    <dt style="font-family:'Courier New';color:grey;"><strong>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience.</strong></dt>
  <dd style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>I am interested in Cyber security I believe their job is very important and beneficial for society. I was always interested in Cyber security but my interest increased and increased as I saw Australia in general struggling in the Cyber security sector. With China being constantly on the news for their Cyber attacks on Australia I thought to myself that I should step up to help in any way I can. Now I have both an interest and good motivation which always keeps me going. I believe I can help Australia to strengthen their Cyber security defense and attack. This is my story, my motivation and I believe, my purpose.</strong></dd>
    <dt style="font-family:'Courier New';color:grey;"><strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></dt>
  <dd style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>I believe RMIT is the best in teaching the IT/CS field and one of the best University’s there is in Melbourne. I was also lucky enough to receive an scholarship at this great university with it’s huge facilities.</strong></dd>
    <dt style="font-family:'Courier New';color:grey;"><strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></dt>
    <dd style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>I expect to learn many things which are beneficial regardless of the specialty any student chooses. Some examples of this so far are the fact that I am learning HTML and CSS coding in my Intro to IT units, learning Python programming in my Intro to programming unit, learning about data science in my Practical Database concepts unit and SQL programming which is also beneficial. I hope to learn more about Cyber security in the future when I choose my majors and specialize in the field.</strong></dd>

    <dt style="font-family:'Courier New';color:green;"><strong>Requirement</strong></dt>

<dt style="font-family:'Courier New';color:green;"><strong>IT Security Specialist Job Outlook</strong></dt>
  <dd style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>Employment of IT security specialists is expected to increase by thirty-two percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the 5% average for all U.S. occupations. Security will remain a top concern for IT hiring managers as the frequency, scope and complexity of cyber-attacks continues to rise.
Aggressive government mandates are helping to drive demand for IT security specialists, for instance the DoD 8570 initiative, which requires Department of Defense (DoD) employees, military personnel, homeland security officers, and private contractors with access to sensitive data to get trained and certified in information security topics relevant to their access and position.
"Security is the only area of certified IT skills that has never had a negative quarter throughout this recession," says David Foote, CEO and Chief Research Officer of leading research firm, Foote Partners. "We've never had a three-month period with a loss or decline in premiums for IT security specialists."
